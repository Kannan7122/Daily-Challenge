Program :


A string S and an integer P denoting the position of the starting character in S are passed as the
input. The program must print the alternate characters in S starting from the position P.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= P <= Length of S
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains P.
Output Format:
The first line contains the alternate characters in S starting from the position P.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcdefghijkl
4
Output:
dfhjl

The 4th character in the string abcdefghijkl is d.
So the alternate characters from the character d are printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
operations
3
Output:
eain




Code :

#Your code below
sen = input()
num = int(input())
num = num-1

while(num<len(sen)):
    print(sen[num],end="")
    num+=2
