Program :


The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the output based on the
conditions given below.
- If the even integers have occurred more number of times than the odd integers then the program
must print even as the output. 
- If the odd integers have occurred more number of times than the even integers then the program
must print odd as the output. 
- If the even integers and the odd integers have occurred equal number of times then the program
must print -1 as the output. 
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each Integer Value <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains odd or even or -1.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 
10
1 6 5 3 5 7 8 5 2 3
Output:
odd
Explanation:
The odd integers are 1, 5, 3, 5, 7, 5, 3 and the count is 7
The even integers are 6, 8, 2 and the count is 3
Here the odd integers count is maximum  
Hence the output is odd
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Output:
-1






Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int arr[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        scanf("%d ",&arr[i]);
    }
    int c1=0,c2=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
        if(arr[i]%2==0) {
            c1++;
        }
        else {
            c2++;
        }
    }
    if(c1>c2)
        printf("even");
    else if(c2>c1)
        printf("odd");
    else
        printf("-1");
}
