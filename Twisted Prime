Program :


The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print YES if N is a twisted
prime number. Else the program must print NO as the output. A number is said to be twisted prime
if it is a prime number and reverse of the number is also a prime number.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^16
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
Output Format:
The first line contains either YES or NO.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
97
Output:
YES
Explanation:
97 is a prime number.
The reverse of 97 is 79. So 79 is also a prime number.
Hence the output is YES
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
34
Output:
NO




Code :

import sys
import math

def isprime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
        
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n))+1):
        if n%i == 0:
            return False
    
    return True

def getreverse(n):
    reverse=0
    while n!=0:
        reverse=reverse*10+n%10
        n//=10
    return reverse
    
def main():
    n=int(input())
    if isprime(n) and isprime(getreverse(n)):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main();
