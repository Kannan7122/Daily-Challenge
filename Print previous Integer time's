Program :


The program must accept an integer N and for each digit D, it must be printed the number of times
the value of the digit following it. The last digit does not have any digit following it, so it must not be
printed.
Boundary condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^7
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the digits as per the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 
1232
Output:
1122233 
Explanation:
The digit 1 has 2 after it. So 1 is repeated two times.
The digit 2 has the digit 3 after it. So 2 is repeated 3 times.
The digit 3 has the digit 2 before it. So 3 is repeated 2 times.
The fourth digit 2 does not have any digit after it and hence is ignored.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1546
Output:
111115555444444




Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char ch[100];
    scanf("%s",&ch);
    int n=strlen(ch);
    for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++) {
        int x=ch[i] - '0';
        int y=ch[i+1] - '0';
        while(y!=0) {
            printf("%d",x);
            y--;
        }
    }
}
