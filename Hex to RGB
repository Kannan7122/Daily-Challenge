Program :


The program must accept a 24-bit color code in hexadecimal representation as the input. The
program must convert the color code to (R,G,B) representation and print it in the format as shown
in the Example Input/Output section.
Boundary Condition(s):
000000 <= Hexadecimal color code <= FFFFFF
Input Format:
The first line contains # followed by 6 hexadecimal digits.
Output Format:
The first line contains the (R,G,B) representation as shown in the Example Input/Output section.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
#001AFF
Output:
(0,26,255)
Explanation:
The first two digit value is 00 which is converted to decimal as 0.
Hence 0 is printed for the color R.
The second two digit value is 1A which is converted to decimal as 26.
Hence 26 is printed for the color G.
The third two digit value is FF which is converted to decimal 255.
Hence 255 is printed for the color B.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
#C0FFEE
Output:
(192,255,238)





Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str=sc.next();
		String s1=str.substring(1,3);
		String s2=str.substring(3,5);
		String s3=str.substring(5,7);
		System.out.print("("+Integer.parseInt(s1,16)+","+Integer.parseInt(s2,16)+","+Integer.parseInt(s3,16)+")");
	}
}
