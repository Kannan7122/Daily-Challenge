Program :


The program must accept a list of integers as the input. The program must invert the sign of all the
integers in the list and print them as the output. If an integer is 0 (neither positive nor negative) then
print 0 as it is.
Boundary Condition(s):
-1000 <= Each integer value <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains a list of integers separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified list of integers separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 7 -2 8 -7 -9 6
Output:
-5 -7 2 -8 7 9 -6
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
-77 85 48 -26
Output:
77 -85 -48 26





Code :

#Your code below
arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
for i in arr:
    if i == 0:
        print(i,end=" ")
    elif i > 0:
        print(0-i,end=" ")
    else:
        print(abs(i),end=" ")
