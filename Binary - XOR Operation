Program :


The program must accept the binary representation of two integers X and Y as the input. The program
must print the result of the bitwise XOR operation of the two binary representations (X ^ Y) as the
output.
Note: The number of bits in the binary representation of X and Y are always equal.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of each binary representation <= 63
Input Format:
The first line contains the binary representation of X.
The second line contains the binary representation of Y.
Output Format:
The first line contains the binary representation of X ^ Y.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1010100
0100101
Output:
1110001
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
1110
1010
Output:
0100



Code :

#Your code below
s1 = input()
s2 = input()
for i in range(len(s1)-1):
    if s1[i]=='1' and s2[i]=='1' or s1[i]=='0' and s2[i]=='0' :
        print("0",end="")
    else:
        print("1",end="")
