Program :


The program accepts a string S and an integer N as the input. The program must rotate the string S
for N times in anti-clockwise direction and print the modified string as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
mangoes
3
Output:
goesman
Explanation:
After the first anti-clockwise rotation, the string becomes "angoesm".
After the second anti-clockwise rotation, the string becomes "ngoesma".
After the third anti-clockwise rotation, the string becomes "goesman".
Hence the output is goesman
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
hi
10
Output:
hi




Code :

#Your code below
s = input().strip()
x = int(input())
k = x%(len(s))
res = s[k:]+s[:k]
print(res)
