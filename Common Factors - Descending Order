Program :


The program must accept two positive integers X and Y as the input. The program must print the
common factors of X and Y in the descending order.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Y <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains X and Y separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the common factors of X and Y in the reverse order.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
15 20
Output:
5 1
Explanation:
The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5 and 15.
The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20.
Here the common factors of 15 and 20 are 1 and 5. So they are printed in descending order.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
20 10
Output:
10 5 2 1





Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int x,y;
    scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);
    int a,b;
    if(x>y) {
        a=x;
        b=y;
    }
    else {
        a=y;
        b=x;
    }
    for(int i=a;i>=1;i--) {
        if(x%i==0 && y%i==0) {
            printf("%d ",i);
        }
    }
}
