The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the output based on the
following conditions.
- If N is odd then the program must print the middle three integers as the output.
- If N is even then the program must print the middle four integers as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
5 <= N <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains either middle three or middle four integers separated by a space based on
the conditions mentioned above.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
11 22 33 44 55
Output:
22 33 44
Explanation:
The integer N is odd.
So the middle three integers are 22, 33 and 34 (11, 22, 33, 44, 55) are printed.
Hence the output is 22 33 44
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
51 23 43 78 19 25 36 43
Output:
43 78 19 25





Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int arr[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d ",&arr[i]);
    }
    if(n%2!=0)
    {
        int mid=n/2;
        printf("%d %d %d",arr[mid-1],arr[mid],arr[mid+1]);
    }
    else
    {
        int mid=n/2;
        printf("%d %d %d %d",arr[mid-2],arr[mid-1],arr[mid],arr[mid+1]);
    }
}
