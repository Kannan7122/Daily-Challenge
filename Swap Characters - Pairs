Program :


The program accept a string S and N pairs as the input. Each pair contains two
integers P1 and P2 representing the position of two characters in the string S. For each pair, the
program must swap the characters in P1 and P2. Finally, the program must print the modified
string S as the output.
Note: The values of P1 and P2 are always not equal.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 1000
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= P1, P2 <= Length of S
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains N.
The next N lines each contain two integers representing P1 and P2 separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string S.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
Cyclone
2
1 3
7 5
Output:
cyCleno






Code :

#Your code below
s = input()
n = int(input())
l = list(s)
for i in range(n):
    x,y = map(int,input().split())
    x = x-1
    y = y-1
    l[x],l[y] = l[y],l[x]
ss = "".join(l)
print(ss)
