Program :


The program must accept five integers A, B, X, Y and Z as the input. The program must print the
multiples of X, Y and Z in the range from A to B (inclusive of A and B) as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= A <= X, Y, Z <= B <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of A and B separated by space(s).
The second line contains the values of X, Y and Z separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the multiples of X, Y and Z in the range from A to B (inclusive of A and B)
separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2 15
3 4 6
Output:
3 4 6 8 9 12 15
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
20 50
24 30 41
Output:
24 30 41 48





Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int a,b,x,y,z;
    scanf("%d %d\n%d %d %d",&a,&b,&x,&y,&z);
    for(int i=a;i<=b;i++) {
        if(i%x==0 || i%y==0 || i%z==0) {
            printf("%d ",i);
        }
    }
