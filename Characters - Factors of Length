The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must calculate the length of string S
as L. Then the program must print the characters which are present at the positions of the factors
of L in ascending order as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the string S.
Output Format:
The first line contains the characters based on the above conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack
Output:
sik
Explanation:
The length of the string "skillrack" is 9.
The factors of 9 are 1, 3 and 9.
So the characters present at the positions 1, 3 and 9 are printed.
Hence the output is sik
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
google
Output:
gooe







Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str=sc.next();
		int n=str.length();
		int[] arr=new int[1000];
		int g=0;
		for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
		{
		    if(n%i==0)
		    {
		        arr[g]=i;
		        g++;
		    }
		}
		for(int i=0;i<g;i++)
		{
		    System.out.print(str.charAt(arr[i]-1));
		}
	}
}
