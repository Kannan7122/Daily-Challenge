The program must accept two integers N and X as the input. The program must print the integers
from 1 to N for X times as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= X <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains N and X separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the integers separated by a space as per the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10 2
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
