Program :


The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print all the even factors of
N in ascending order as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^5
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains all the even factors of N separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
16
Output:
2 4 8 16
Explanation:
The factors of 16 are 1 2 4 8 16.
The even factors of 16 are 2 4 8 16.
So 2 4 8 16 are printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
100
Output:
2 4 10 20 50 100





Code :

#Your code below
a=int(input())
b=[]
for i in range(1,a+1):
    if a%i==0 and i%2==0:
        print(i,end=' ')
