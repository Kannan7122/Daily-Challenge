Program :


The program must accept an integer N as the input. If the number of digits in N is even then the
program must print product of every two digits in N as the output. If the number of the digits in N is
odd then the program must print the product of every two digits in N then it must print the
remaining digit (last digit) as it is as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^15
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the integers separated by space as per the given condition.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1234
Output:
2 12
Explanation:
The number of digits in 1234 is 4 which is even.
The product of the first two digits is 2 (1 * 2).
The product of the next two digits is 12 (3 * 4).
Hence the output is 2 12
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
19849
Output:
9 32 9






Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str=sc.next();
		int n=str.length();
		int f=0;
		for(int i=0;i<n;i+=2)
		{
		    if(i==n-1)
		    {
		        f=1;
		        break;
		    }
		    int a=Character.getNumericValue(str.charAt(i));
		    int b=Character.getNumericValue(str.charAt(i+1));
		    System.out.print(a*b+" ");
		}
		if(f==1)
		{
		    System.out.print(str.charAt(n-1));
		}

	}
