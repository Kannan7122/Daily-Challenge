Program :


The program must accept two integers N and K as the input. The program must print the minimum
number of steps required to reach 0 from N based on the following steps.
-If N is divisible by K then divide N by k.
-If N is not divisible by K then decrement N by 1.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^18
2 <= K <= 10^18
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of N and K separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the minimum number of steps required to reach 0 from N.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
29 3
Output:
6
Explanation:
29 -> 28 -> 27 -> 9 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
31 2
Output:
9



Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    long long int n,x,cnt=0;
    scanf("%lld %lld",&n,&x);
    while(n>0)
    {
        if(n%x==0)
        {
            n=n/x;
            cnt++;
        }
        else
        {
            long long int a=n%x;
            n=n-a;
            cnt=cnt+a;
        }
    }
    printf("%lld",cnt);
}
