The students of a class has to write two exams in Science and Maths. For the students passing the
exam either a ball or a pen must be given as a prize based on the following conditions.
 - If a ball is given for passing Science exam then a pen is given for passing Maths exam.
 - If a pen is given for passing Science exam then a ball is given for passing Maths exam.
The price of a ball B and the price of a pen P is passed as input to the program. The number of
students N taking the test is also passed as the input to the program. The program must print the
minimum amount A required to buy the prizes for the student.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= B, P <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of B and P separated by a space.
The second line contains the value of N.
The next N lines contain the pass or fail status of N students (1 indicates pass and 0 indicates fail)
in Science and Maths exams.
Output Format:
The first line contains the value of the minimum amount A required.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 10
6
1 0
1 1
1 0
0 1
1 1
1 0
Output:
55
Explanation:
Ball cost = 5 and Pen cost = 10.
Total students who passed Science = 5.
Total students who passed Maths = 3.
If we assign ball to Science and pen to maths, then total cost = 5*5 + 10*3 = 55.
If we assign pen to Science and ball to maths, then total cost = 10*5 + 5*3 = 65.
The minimum cost is 55.




Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int c1,c2;
    scanf("%d %d",&c1,&c2);
    int n,s=0,m=0;
    scanf("\n%d",&n);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        int x,y;
        scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);
        if(x==1)
        {
            s++;
        }
        if(y==1)
        {
            m++;
        }
    }
    int s1=(s*c1)+(m*c2);
    int s2=(s*c2)+(m*c1);
    if(s1<s2)
    {
        printf("%d",s1);
    }
    else if(s2<s1)
    {
        printf("%d",s2);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("%d",s1);
    }
}
