Program :


The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the integers from 1 to
N having all their digits as odd.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the integers separated by a space as per the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12
Output:
1 3 5 7 9 11
Explanation:
2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 are having even digits in it. So they are not printed.
The integers from 1 to 12 having all their digits as odd are printed (1 3 5 7 9 11).
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
55
Output:
1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 31 33 35 37 39 51 53 55


Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        int x=i;
        int cnt1=0,cnt2=0;
        while(x!=0)
        {
            int a=x%10;
            if(a==1 || a==3 || a==5 || a==7 || a==9)
            {
                cnt1++;
            }
            x/=10;
            cnt2++;
        }
        if(cnt1==cnt2)
        {
            printf("%d ",i);
        }
    }
}
