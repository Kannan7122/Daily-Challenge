Program :


The program must accept three integers A, B and C as the input. The program must print YES if C
can be obtained by repeatedly subtracting B from A (that is A - B) as the output. Else the program
must print NO as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= A, B, C <= 1000
Input Format:
The first line contains the values A, B and C separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains either YES or NO.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
71 7 15
Output:
YES
Explanation:
71 - 7 = 64
64 - 7 = 57
57 - 7 = 50
50 - 7 = 43
43 - 7 = 36
36 - 7 = 29
29 - 7 = 22
22 - 7 = 15
Here 15 is obtained by repeatedly subtracting 7 from 71.
Hence the output is YES
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
89 19 10
Output:
NO



Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n,x,y;
    scanf("%d %d %d",&n,&x,&y);
    int cnt=0;
    while(n>0)
    {
        n=n-x;
        if(n==y)
        {
            printf("YES");
            cnt++;
            return;
        }
    }
    if(cnt==0)
    {
        printf("NO");
    }
}
