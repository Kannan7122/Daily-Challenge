Program:


The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must increment all the even
digits of N by 1 and decrement all the odd digits of N by 1. Then the program must print the
modified N as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first line contains modified N.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12389
Output:
3298
Explanation:
1 is odd so it is decremented as 0 the number becomes 02389. The leading zero for integer is
removed as 2389.
2 is even so it is incremented by 1 the number becomes 3389.
3 is odd so it is decremented by 1 the number becomes 3289.
8 is even so it is incremented by 1 the number becomes 3299.
9 is odd so it is decremented by 1 the number becomes 3298.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
41571
Output:
50460


Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str=sc.next();
		int n=str.length();
		int cnt=0;
		String s="";
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
		    int x=Character.getNumericValue(str.charAt(i));
		    if(x%2==0)
		    {
		        x++;
		    }
		    else
		    {
		        x--;
		    }
		    char ch=(char) (x+'0');
		    s+=ch;
		}
		System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(s));
	}
}
