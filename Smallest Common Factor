Program :


The program must accept two positive integers N1 and N2 as the input. The program must print
the smallest common factor of N1 and N2 which is greater than 1 as the output. If there is no
common factor other than 1 then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N1, N2 <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of N1 and N2 separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the common factor.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
15 30
Output:
3
Explanation:
3 is the smallest number (greater than 1) which divides both 15 and 30.
Hence 3 is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 7
Output:
-1




Code :

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n1,n2;
    scanf("%d %d",&n1,&n2);
    int arr1[n1],arr2[n2];
    int g=0,h=0;
    for(int i=2;i<=n1;i++) {
        if(n1%i==0) {
            arr1[g]=i;
            g++;
        }
    }
    for(int i=2;i<=n2;i++) {
        if(n2%i==0) {
            arr2[h]=i;
            h++;
        }
    }
    for(int i=0;i<g;i++) {
        for(int j=0;j<h;j++) {
            if(arr1[i]==arr2[j]) {
                printf("%d ",arr1[i]);
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("-1");
}
