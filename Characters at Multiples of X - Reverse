The program must accept a string S and an integer X as the input. The program must print the
characters which are present at the positions of multiples of X in reverse order as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100
1 <= X <= Length of S
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains X.
Output Format:
The first line contains the characters which are present at the positions of multiple of X in reverse
order.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skillrack
3
Output:
kri
Explanation:
The characters which are present at the positions of multiples of 3 are i, r and k.
So they are reversed and printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
employee
2
Output:
eylm



Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        String str=sc.next();
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        int l=str.length();
        String s="";
        for(int i=0;i<l;i++)
        {
            if((i+1)%n==0)
            {
                s+=str.charAt(i);
            }
        }
        StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder(s);
        StringBuilder rev=sb.reverse();
        System.out.print(rev.toString());
	}
}
