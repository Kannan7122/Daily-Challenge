Program :


The program must accept N integers and an integer X as the input. The program must print the
count of consecutive X integers (among N integers) in which all the X integers are different as the
output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= X <= N
Input Format:
The first line contains two integers N and X separated by a space.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains count the number of consecutive X integers in which all the X integers are
unique.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6 3
1 2 3 4 4 5
Output:
2
Explanation:
X = 3,
The first three integers are 1, 2 and 3. Here all the integers are unique. So the count is 1.
The next three consecutive integers are 2, 3 and 4. Here all the integers are unique. So the count
becomes 2.
The next three consecutive integers are 3, 4 and 4. Here duplicate integers have occurred.
The next three consecutive integers are 4, 4 and 5. Here duplicate integers have occurred.
Hence the output is 2
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8 5
9 8 1 8 1 2 4 5
Output:
1

        int cnt=1;

            for(int k=j+1;k<x;k++) {
                if(arr[j]==arr[k]) {
                    c=1;
                }
            }
            if(c==0) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        if(cnt==k) {
            count++;
        }
        if(x<n) {
            x++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d",count);
